# 2026-02-08 – Daily IT Practice

## Overview
Today focused on strengthening cross‑platform OS skills. I practiced Linux device management, kernel checks, and system updates, and explored Windows Update concepts and Sysinternals tools. 
This session reinforced my OS Power User coursework and built real troubleshooting intuition.

## Commands / Work Done

### Linux
```bash
uname -r
ls -l /dev
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade

Windows PowerShell
winget search procmon
winget install --id Microsoft.Sysinternals.ProcessMonitor
& "C:\Program Files\Sysinternals\Procmon.exe"

Tools Practiced
- Process Monitor (ProcMon)
- Process Explorer (procexp)
- APT package manager
- Linux device file inspection
- Kernel version verification
What I Learned
- Linux exposes hardware as files under /dev.
- Character devices handle byte‑stream I/O; block devices handle storage.
• 	Windows Update delivers security, quality, feature, and driver updates.
• 	ProcMon provides deep tracing of file, registry, and process events.
Scenarios
• 	Trace a failing Windows installer using ProcMon filters.
• 	Identify missing Linux storage devices using  and .
• 	Perform safe Linux system upgrades using APT.
• 	Verify Sysinternals installations and run tools from PowerShell.
- Device names like sda, sdb, sdc represent kernel‑detected disks.
- APT manages all system and application updates.
