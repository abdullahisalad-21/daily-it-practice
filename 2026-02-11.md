# Daily Practice — 11 Feb 2026

## Overview
Today focused on cross‑platform filesystem repair and disk‑usage analysis on both Windows (NTFS) and Linux (ext4). 
Practiced real admin‑level tools, safe repair workflows, and installed advanced utilities for deeper analysis.

## Objectives
- Strengthen filesystem repair knowledge on Windows and Linux
- Practice disk‑usage commands (`df`, `du`, DU.exe)
- Understand journaling and self‑healing mechanisms
- Install and use advanced tools (Sysinternals DU, ncdu)

## Tools & Commands Used
### Windows
- Get-PSDrive  
- Get-Volume  
- fsutil volume diskfree  
- fsutil repair query C:  
- cleanmgr /sageset:1  
- cleanmgr /sagerun:1  
- defrag C: /L  
- chkdsk /f  
- Sysinternals DU.exe  

### Linux
- df -h, df  
- du -h, du  
- du -h ~ | sort -h | tail  
- sudo du -xh / | sort -h | tail  
- sudo fsck  
- ncdu  

## Steps Completed
### Windows
- Checked disk usage using PowerShell and CMD  
- Installed Sysinternals DU.exe  
- Ran TRIM optimization  
- Automated Disk Cleanup  
- Queried NTFS self‑healing state  
- Scheduled chkdsk repair at reboot  

### Linux
- Analyzed filesystem usage with df  
- Inspected directory sizes with du  
- Identified largest directories using pipelines  
- Installed ncdu  
- Attempted fsck on mounted root and learned safe procedure  

## Problems & Fixes
### Windows
- DU.exe not recognized → Installed manually  
- chkdsk cannot lock C: → Scheduled at reboot  

### Linux
- fsck aborted on mounted filesystem → Learned correct safe workflow  
- fsck /dev/sda danger → Understood why it destroys disks  

## What I Learned
- NTFS self‑healing modes  
- TRIM vs defrag  
- Disk Cleanup automation  
- ext4 journaling  
- df vs du  
- Safe fsck usage  
- ncdu for interactive analysis  

## Related Files
- DU.exe installation directory  
- Linux disk‑usage outputs  
- chkdsk logs after reboot  

## Next Steps
- Review chkdsk results  
- Use ncdu to clean Linux  
- Practice fsck in recovery mode  
- Update repos with today’s work
