# Daily IT Practice — 07 February 2026

## Overview
Today’s session focused on Linux package management, specifically practicing manual installation of `.deb` packages using `dpkg`, resolving dependency issues with `apt`, and troubleshooting download errors. 
This session simulated real IT support tasks involving software deployment, environment detection issues, and command‑line troubleshooting.

## Activities Completed

### 1. Downloading .deb Packages
- Practiced using `wget` to download software packages.
- Learned that URLs containing `?` and `&` must be wrapped in quotes.
- Successfully downloaded:
  - `codium_1.108.20787_amd64.deb`

### 2. Installing Software with dpkg
- Attempted installation using:
  ```bash
  sudo dpkg -i codium_1.108.20787_amd64.deb

- Encountered dependency errors (expected behavior with dpkg).

Fixing Dependency Problems
sudo apt --fix-broken install
- APT automatically downloaded and configured missing libraries.
- Installation completed successfully.
Verifying Installation
codium --version
- Encountered a false WSL detection warning.
- Confirmed this is safe on native Ubuntu systems
Preparing for Second Package Installation
- Attempted to download Discord .deb.
- Encountered shell misinterpretation due to unquoted URL.
- Corrected with:
wget "https://discord.com/api/download?platform=linux&format=deb" -O discord.deb
Errors Encountered & Fixes
❌ Typo Errors
- Mistyped dpkg as dpkkg.
- Mistyped filenames (.dep, wrong architecture, wrong spelling).
- Fix: Verified filenames using ls and re‑typed accurately.
❌ 404 Not Found
- Caused by incorrect VSCodium filename.
- Fix: Used exact versioned .deb from GitHub release.
❌ URL Parsing Error
- Shell split the Discord URL into multiple commands.
- Fix: Wrapped URL in quotes.
❌ Dependency Errors
- dpkg cannot resolve dependencies.
- Fix: sudo apt --fix-broken install.
❌ False WSL Detection
- Codium incorrectly detected WSL on native Ubuntu.
- Fix: Safe to continue with y.

- What I've learned 
- Manual .deb installation workflow.
- Dependency troubleshooting using APT.
- Correct use of wget with complex URLs.
- Understanding dpkg vs apt roles.
- Recognizing and handling environment detection quirks.
- Linux command accuracy and filename sensitivity
