# Daily IT Practice — 02-February-2026

## 🧠 What I Practiced Today
Today I completed two major labs focused on Windows and Linux permissions. I worked with ACLs, ownership, inheritance, and troubleshooting permission issues across both operating systems.

## 🪟 Windows Administration (Lab 01)
- Viewed file and folder permissions using `icacls` and `Get-Acl`
- Granted and removed permissions for specific users
- Managed inheritance (`/inheritance:d` and `/inheritance:e`)
- Reset permissions to inherited defaults
- Fixed “Access Denied” by relaunching PowerShell as Administrator
- Verified group membership using `whoami /groups`
## 🐧 Linux Administration (Lab 02)
- Viewed permissions using `ls -l` and `ls -ld`
- Modified permissions using symbolic and numeric modes (700, 720, 764, 777)
- Changed ownership using `sudo chown`
- Secured folders by adjusting user/group/other permissions
- Troubleshot permission errors using `sudo`

## 🔐 Security Fundamentals Learned
- Windows ACL structure (DACLs, ACEs, inheritance)
- Linux permission model (user, group, other)
- Least privilege principle
- Ownership and access control
- Securing sensitive files and directories

## 🗂️ GitHub & Documentation Work
- Updated Lab 01 and Lab 02 READMEs with professional summaries
- Created accurate `commands.md` files for both labs
- Improved repo structure across all lab repositories
- Added daily updates to:
  - windows-admin-labs
  - linux-admin-labs
  - networking-labs
  - security-basics

## 📌 Summary
Today was a strong hands-on day focused on permissions, ACLs, ownership, and documentation. 
I completed two full labs, updated multiple repos, and strengthened my understanding of system security across Windows and Linux.
