# 🗓️ Daily IT Practice — 18 February 2026

## ⭐ 1. Overview
Today’s practice focused on **cross‑platform resource monitoring and process management**. I worked with Windows PowerShell, Process Explorer, Linux process tools, and mobile OS process lifecycle concepts. The goal was to strengthen my understanding of how different operating systems manage CPU, memory, disk, and background processes.

## 🎯 2. Objectives
- Monitor processes and system resources in Windows  
- Explore Linux process management and the `/proc` filesystem  
- Understand iOS and Android process lifecycle rules  
- Practice killing processes safely in Linux  
- Complete supplemental readings for Windows, Linux, and mobile OS resource management  

## 🛠️ 3. Tools & Commands Used

### 🪟 Windows
- `Get-Process`
- `Sort-Object`
- `Select-Object`
- `Stop-Process`
- Task Manager  
- Resource Monitor  
- Process Explorer  

### 🐧 Linux
- `ps -ef`, `ps aux`
- `grep`
- `pstree -p`
- `kill`, `kill -KILL`, `pkill`
- `/proc/<PID>/status`
- `/proc` exploration

### 📱 Mobile OS Concepts
- iOS app lifecycle  
- Android process priority system  
- Android activity lifecycle  

## 🧩 4. Steps Completed

### 🪟 Windows
- Sorted processes by CPU usage:
  ```
  get-process | sort cpu -descending | select -first 3 -property ID, ProcessName, CPU
  ```
- Identified high‑CPU processes  
- Installed and launched Process Explorer  
- Analyzed process trees, handles, DLLs, and CPU usage  
- Reviewed Microsoft Learn documentation for `Get‑Process` outputs  

### 🐧 Linux
- Listed all processes using `ps -ef`  
- Viewed parent/child relationships with `pstree -p`  
- Explored `/proc/<PID>/status`  
- Killed Firefox using:
  ```
  pkill -9 firefox
  ```
- Completed supplemental reading on Linux resource monitoring  

### 📱 Mobile OS
- Studied iOS background execution rules  
- Reviewed Android process priority and lifecycle  
- Compared iOS vs Android background behavior  

## 🐞 5. Problems & Fixes

### ❗ Problem: Many Firefox processes  
**Fix:** Used `pkill -9 firefox` to kill all.

### ❗ Problem: PowerShell typo (`-firts`)  
**Fix:** Corrected to `-first`.

### ❗ Problem: Unsure if Process Explorer installed  
**Fix:** Verified via Winget and launched manually.

## 📚 6. What I Learned
- PowerShell exposes process info via `System.Diagnostics.Process`  
- Process Explorer = Windows version of `htop` + `lsof` + `pstree`  
- Linux `/proc` is the foundation of all monitoring tools  
- iOS aggressively suspends apps  
- Android kills background processes based on priority  
- Resource monitoring differs across OSes  
- Killing processes requires understanding parent/child relationships

- PowerShell screenshots  
- Process Explorer screenshots  
- Linux terminal screenshots  
- Supplemental reading summaries  

## 🔜 8. Next Steps
- Document Windows vs Linux vs Mobile process management  
- Practice `htop`, `iotop`, `iostat`  
- Explore PerfMon counters  
- Build PowerShell monitoring cheat sheet  
- Continue Module 5 documentation in Windows‑admin repo
