🧩 1. Overview
Today’s practice covered:
• 	VirtualBox disk management
• 	Linux disk partitioning and filesystem creation
• 	Mounting/unmounting filesystems
• 	UUID identification
• 	Windows administrative concepts (ACLs, DACLs, SACLs, password policies)
• 	PowerShell user/group management review
• 	Troubleshooting mount errors
• 	Understanding filesystem recovery structures
This session strengthened ymy cross‑platform IT support skills.
🎯 2. Objectives
- Strengthen Linux disk administration skills
- Reinforce Windows ACL and security concepts
- Practice filesystem creation and mounting
- Understand how OSes manage storage at a low level
- Improve troubleshooting confidence
- Document everything in a professional, portfolio‑ready format
🛠️ 3. Tools & Commands Used
Linux
lsblk
sudo parted -l
sudo parted /dev/sdb
mklabel gpt
mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 5GiB
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
mkdir ~/USB
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 ~/USB
Windows (concepts + workflow)
• 	Disk Management
• 	FAT32 vs NTFS
• 	MBR vs GPT
• 	Creating primary partitions
• 	Selecting Disk 0
• 	Formatting partitions
• 	Mounting/unmounting volumes
• 	Reading:
• 	Mounting and Unmounting Filesystems in Linux
• 	Disk Partition and Filesystem Essentials
• 	MBR vs GPT
🧱 4. Steps Completed
4.1 Linux Disk Management
• 	Added new 8GB disk in VirtualBox
• 	Verified /dev/sdb
• 	Created GPT partition table
• 	Created 5GB partition
• 	Formatted with ext4
• 	Mounted to ~/USB
• 	Verified lost+found
• 	Unmounted
• 	Retrieved UUID
4.2 Windows Disk & Filesystem Concepts
FAT32 vs NTFS
- FAT32 → older, simple, widely compatible
- NTFS → modern, secure, supports permissions, journaling
MBR vs GPT
- MBR → older, 4 primary partitions, 2TB limit
- GPT → modern, supports large disks, required for UEFI
Disk Partitioning Workflow
- Select disk (Disk 0)
- Create primary partition
- Choose filesystem (NTFS or FAT32)
- Format partition
- Assign drive letter
- Mount/unmount volume
Formatting
- NTFS for Windows system drives
- FAT32 for compatibility (USB, external devices)
🧩 5. Problems & Fixes
Linux mount point error
mount: mount point does not exist
Fix:
Created mount point with mkdir ~/USB.
Unmount message
not mounted
Fix:
Recognized it was already unmounted.
📘 6. What I Learned
• 	How Linux and Windows structure disks differently
• 	Why GPT is preferred over MBR
• 	How ext4 differs from NTFS and FAT32
• 	How to safely mount/unmount filesystems
• 	How to troubleshoot mount errors
• 	How to format partitions in both OSes
• 	How VirtualBox presents virtual disks
🚀 7. Next Steps
• 	Add Linux disk to /etc/fstab
• 	Practice NTFS permissions
• 	Create multiple partitions in Linux
• 	Explore LVM
sudo umount ~/USB
