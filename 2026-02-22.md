**✅ DAILY PRACTICE REPO — Documentation
🌅 Overview**
I began the day by starting Module 6 of Course 3, which focuses on practical OS operations used daily in IT Support. 
I reviewed remote access concepts, virtualization management, log monitoring, and OS deployment fundamentals. 
I also performed hands‑on tasks including RDP, SSH, PuTTY, PowerShell remote commands, and VirtualBox management.
