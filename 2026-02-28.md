*📘 Overview*
Today I focused on improving my IT documentation workflow by setting up a professional Git environment inside my WSL Ubuntu terminal. I created a dedicated GitHub workspace, cloned all my repositories locally, and learned how to automate my documentation process using Git commands instead of relying on the GitHub web interface. This session helped me move closer to a real sysadmin workflow.

*🎯 Objectives*
- Create a local GitHub workspace inside WSL
- Clone all my GitHub repositories
- Understand how Git works in a Linux environment
- Learn the professional workflow for adding, committing, and pushing documentation
- Prepare for full automation of daily lab documentation

*🛠️ Tools & Commands Used*
- mkdir -p ~/github
- cd ~/github
- git clone <repo-url>
- nano filename.md
- git add .
- git commit -m "message"
- git push

*🚀 Steps Completed*
1. Created a GitHub workspace in WSL
I made a folder called github inside my WSL home directory and moved into it.
2. Cloned all my GitHub repositories
I successfully cloned:
- google-it-support-labs
- daily-it-practice
- linux-admin-labs
- windows-admin-labs
- networking-labs
- security-basics
Each repo downloaded correctly with all files and commit history.
3. Verified that all repos are now local
I confirmed that each repo exists inside ~/github, meaning I can now edit files directly from WSL.
4. Learned the professional Git workflow
I practiced the correct workflow:
- Enter repo
- Create .md file with nano
- Paste documentation
- Save
- git add
- git commit
- git push
5. Prepared to automate documentation
I now understand how to build a script that:
- Creates a file
- Opens nano
- Commits and pushes automatically

*🐞 Problems & Fixes*
- Problem: I used to manually create files through GitHub’s web UI.
Fix: I learned how to create, edit, commit, and push files entirely from the terminal.
- Problem: I didn’t know where to store my repos locally.
Fix: I created a dedicated ~/github workspace.
- Problem: I wasn’t sure how cloning works.
Fix: I cloned all repos and confirmed they downloaded correctly.

*🧠 What I Learned*
- How to create a professional Git workspace in WSL
- How to clone multiple repositories
- How Git tracks changes locally
- How to commit and push documentation like a real IT engineer
- How to use nano to create Markdown files
- How to prepare for automation using shell scripts

*📎 Related Files*
- All cloned repositories inside ~/github
- Future .md documentation files created with nano

*➡️ Next Steps*
- Set up SSH keys for GitHub to avoid entering credentials
- Create an automation script for daily documentation
- Continue practicing Git workflows
- Begin documenting future labs directly from WSL
