# Daily IT Practice — 2026-02-07

## Overview
Today I practiced Linux and Windows package management, focusing on `.deb` installation, dependency resolution, and archive extraction. I compared `apt` vs `dpkg`, learned why dependency issues occur, and installed Google Chrome successfully on Ubuntu. I also reviewed Windows package providers and TAR archive concepts.

## Commands / Work Done

### Linux (.deb installation)
```bash
wget "https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb"
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt --fix-broken install
ls
Archive Work
7z e cool_file.zip
7z x cool_file.zip
tar -cvf archive.tar folder/
tar -xvf archive.tar
tar -tvf archive.tar

Windows PowerShell
Find-Package sysinternals -IncludeDependencies

What I Learned
• 	 is the correct method because it resolves dependencies automatically.
• 	 installs only the file and may leave packages unconfigured.
• 	Dependency failures happen when required libraries are missing or deprecated.
• 	Windows uses centralized repositories (winget), while Linux uses distributed repos.
• 	TAR supports create, extract, list, append, and update operations.
• 	 extracts files without folders;  preserves directory structure.

Scenarios
• 	Installing Chrome on Ubuntu using  files.
• 	Fixing dependency errors using .
• 	Comparing Windows and Linux package ecosystems.
• 	Extracting archives for backup or recovery.
