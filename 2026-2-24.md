**🌅 Daily Practice — February 24, 2026
📘 Overview**
Today I focused on deepening my SysAdmin theory foundations. 
I studied multiple core concepts that appear in real IT environments: vendor life‑cycles, product support phases, change management, and action‑recording tools across Linux and Windows. 
These concepts strengthen my ability to work in structured enterprise environments where documentation, planning, and risk management matter as much as technical skill.
**🎯 Objectives**
• 	Understand the vendor life‑cycle for custom services and commercial products
• 	Break down SysAdmin policy questions and reasoning
• 	Compare infrastructure concepts (datacenter vs cloud)
• 	Learn the difference between firmware and malware
• 	Compare Linux script vs Windows start-transcript
• 	Study change management in detail
• 	Practice structured conceptual analysis using my new “quick summary + comparison + deep dive” rule
**🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used**
- Linux: script, ansi2txt, ansi2html
- Windows: Start-Transcript, Stop-Transcript
- Documentation concepts: vendor life‑cycle, EOL, change management, rollback plans
- SysAdmin concepts: datacenter vs cloud, firmware vs malware, policy decisions
**📝 Concepts Studied Today**
**1. Vendor Life‑Cycle for Custom Services**
I learned how organizations evaluate, select, onboard, manage, and offboard service vendors.
Key phases:
• 	Pre‑contract: identification, qualification, risk mitigation, proposal evaluation
• 	Contract delivery: performance monitoring, risk management, relationship management
• 	Post‑contract: offboarding, warranties, support, equipment return, access removal
This is essential for SysAdmins who interact with vendors for hardware, software, cloud, and outsourced IT projects.
**2. Vendor Life‑Cycle for Commercial Products**
I studied how vendors support their products through:
- Beta testing
- Primary support
- Extended support
- End of Life (EOL)
EOL is a major security risk because patches stop. SysAdmins must track product roadmaps and plan upgrades before support ends.
**3. Datacenter vs Cloud**
I compared traditional on‑prem datacenters with cloud infrastructure.
Key differences: ownership, scaling, cost model, maintenance, reliability, and deployment speed.
Modern SysAdmins must understand hybrid environments.
**4. SysAdmin Policy Questions**
I analyzed common policy decisions:
- Users should not install software (least privilege).
- Passwords must be complex.
- Non‑work websites depend on company policy and risk.
- Company phones must have device passwords.
These decisions balance security, compliance, and productivity.
**5. Firmware vs Malware**
- Firmware: legitimate low‑level software that controls hardware.
- Malware: malicious software designed to exploit systems.
Firmware attacks are extremely dangerous because they persist below the OS.
**6. Linux Script vs Windows Start‑Transcript**
- Linux scripts: automation tools.
- script command: records terminal sessions.
- PowerShell Start-Transcript: logs commands + output.
- GUI actions require tools like OBS or recordMyDesktop.
**7. Change Management**
I studied the full structure of a professional change management plan:
- Responsible team
- Priority
- Description
- Purpose
- Scope
- Schedule
- Rollback plan
- Technical evaluation
- Impact analysis
- Resources
- Training
- Risk level
- Step‑by‑step instructions
- CAB approvals
- User acceptance testing
This is one of the most important disciplines for enterprise SysAdmins.
**🧩 Problems & Fixes**
No technical issues today — this was a pure theory and conceptual study session.
**📚 What I Learned**
- How vendors structure service contracts and product support
- Why EOL is a critical security milestone
- How datacenter and cloud differ in scaling and ownership
- How SysAdmins justify policy decisions
- The difference between firmware and malware
- How to record actions on Linux and Windows
- How to build a complete change management plan
- How to apply my new “quick summary + comparison + deep dive” rule consistently
